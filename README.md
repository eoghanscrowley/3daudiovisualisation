 This is an app combining basic knowledge of three js with the audio api to create a synth whose signal is sent to an analyser Node and the data is used to update a 3d animation.

 The conception of this idea came while building another project (INSERT LINK). I was building an additive synthesizer using Web Audio API. The project essentially abstracted the functionality of the API by created an interactive UI which allowed the user to build their own synth. I'd had a lot of experience with synthesis while using Ableton for music production previously so there was a lot of transferable knowledge to build from.

 The Web Audio API was so easy to use. It's use of nodes allows for easy modular design and MDN's documentation (INSERT LINK) is extensive and well-explained with relevant examples.
